          <h2>Made for the 2019 University of Manitoba Computer Science Students' Association Game Jam</h2>
          <p> Caterpeeler is a game where you are a little caterpillar, who wants to eat leaves and become a butterfly. The world is a dangerous place for the caterpeeler, who must hide from birds, avoid spiders, and stay on the branch to complete their goal.
            <br><br>I made this game for my first ever game jam. I worked with a team of four other people, only one of them with Unity experience. I was largely responsible for the caterpillar itself (locomotion, control, and final look)
            and some of the leaf hiding mechanics, as well as general brainstorming and problem solving with team members. This project was probably the fastest I have ever picked up knowledge on an area of coding, and introduced me to how
            complex game design can be.

          <h2>A discord bot made for a personal server</h2>
          <p>Aeriesbot is a bot made in reference to a joke on a discord server I am a part of, and was created to show one of three gifs every time a variation of that joke was said in chat.
            <br><br>This was my first ever discord bot and I had to follow a lot of tutorials on how to code it, set it up in discord, and keep it running. The server runs it for around twelve hours at a time before going to sleep, so there is 
            still some work to do on that front.
          </p>
          <h3 class='centered'>The code for this bot is hosted on <a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank">Glitch</a> and can be found <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aries-bot77?path=README.md:1:0" target="_blank">here</a></h3>
